 CNN is used for  ; CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) is a type of neural network commonly used for processing and analyzing image data. It is particularly effective for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and classification.

CNNs are designed to automatically learn and identify patterns and features within image data by using convolutional layers that apply filters to the input image. These filters detect edges, corners, and other visual features that are then used to classify and identify objects within the image.

In addition to image processing, CNNs are also used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis. They are also applied in other domains such as speech recognition, time-series analysis, and recommendation systems.
